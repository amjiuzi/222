I am a graduate at [UC San Deigo] (https://www.ucsd.edu), pursuing my vision of addressing rare diseases and unmet medical needs. I focus on the intersection of pharmaceutical science and nanotechnology to build novel [theranostic systems](#publication) that can improve the therapeutic efficiency and treatment experience.

I am actively contributing to [carrier optimization](#projects), and methods that I implemented are controlling geometric and mechanical properties at better nanoscale precision. In my spare time, I enjoy participate in seminars on the practical applications of [LEGO-based](#slider) engineering and programming.
