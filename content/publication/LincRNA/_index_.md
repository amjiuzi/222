abstract: The roles and therapeutic potential of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have attracted increased attention. However, many lncRNAs have not been annotated in AML, and their predictive value for AML therapy remains unclear. In this study, we identified a novel large intergenic noncoding RNA uc002jit.1 (D43770) from a lncRNA microarray. uc002jit.1 is 1800 nt long with a stable secondary structure. We first proved uc002jit.1 is a target gene of nuclear factor kappa B/RELA, RELA regulated uc002jit.1 transcription by binding to its promoter. Additionally, uc002jit.1 knockdown impaired the stability of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) mRNA, and then reduced PARP1 protein content and PARylation level upon DNA damage, thus inhibiting DNA damage repair in AML cells. Moreover, uc002jit.1 knockdown significantly inhibited AML cells proliferation and increased the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro as well as in a mouse model in vivo. Overall, our study indicated that uc002jit.1 may be associated with the occurrence and prognosis of AML and could be a new diagnostic/prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for AML.
